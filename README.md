# Genshin Guess Who

Plans
- A portrait at the top that will bring up the portrait of the character you want the other person to guess
- A dropdown select to select that portrait ^
- Rows of portraits that will be clickable to either put a sign over the character or darken/greyscale them
- You can click on portraits again to unmark them
- Reset button to reset the board (your character excluded, that has to be selected manually each time)
